Jenkis:
* Devops team create a build (.exe file)
* The build is created using maven( Devops team use maven to create the build )
* Developers push their code to repository ,after that devops team make the build using that code
* Once the build is ready, QA team start testing and push automation code to repository
* After that DEVOPS team run the test cases through JENKIS
* DEVEOPS team, do only Smoke and Sanity Test to check the build is stable 
* After that test is passed , Jenkins send the message to all through mail
* QA team download the build from Jenkins only  for testing.
* At the end of the day ,Developers push the code to GIT , after that Devops team, get the code and create a build , within a night the build will be created, this is called CICD.
* After that QA team download the BUILD from Jenkins and start testing.
* Jenkins will be installed in DEVOPS env, we have to configure the ebb for Jenkins 
* Jenkins is seamless Execution, everything happen in the backend


Steps:
  * Jenkins is a open source tool ,we need to download it.
  * Jenkins is a Webbased application 
  * we need to use the localhost8080
  * 8080 is the default port 
  * give initial password from secret file 
  * after that give username and password and emailid
once the configuration done, 
* open the localhost8080
* then, using jenkin we can execute the project in 2 ways 
  1. one is, FREE STYLE project (i.e) using run.bat ( this is for practise purpose)
  2. anothe one is, Maven Projects(Executing using pom.xlm)(real time )

Creating project:

  * Enter the project name.
  * select the project type. 
  * click ok
  * set configurations for the page .
  * select the Build and add the build step->select top level  maven target
  * provide the project loction
  * click apply and save.
  * go to project dashboard -> a new project is created 
  * run the project-> select the project - click on build now -> it will start build
  * project appears in blue color  means passed, grey means not yet run, red means error.
  
  --> for maven project 
  * we need to add maven plugins and then  add in all the available maven plugins  .
  * Add JDK nameand path.
  * we need to give the root pom location.
  * Goals&option : clean install
  * 
  

Continous Integration( CI ):
  * Maven (Build tool)
  * Jenkins (CI tool)
  * GIT(Local Repo)
  * GitHUb(Remote Repo)
